    "The 'cocktail party effect' refers to the ability humans have to attend to one speaker in a noisy room. We will now use ICA to solve a similar but somewhat idealized version of this problem. The code below loads 5 sound files and produces 5 mixed sound files, which are saved to disk so you can listen to them. Use your ICA implementation to de-mix these and reproduce the original source signals. As in the previous exercise, try each of the activation functions and report your results.\n",

Also, mixing is not instantaneous in real life, because the sound from one source arrives at each ear at a different point in time. If you have time left, you can think ways to deal with these issues."

There is a debate if peakness of distributions is associated with kurtosis and some sources state that it's not the case, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis. Therefore, we going to use the fact about thick tails only in the further discussion. \n",
